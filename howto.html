<h1>How to</h1>
<p>To actually do anything here you need to follow these steps.
Step 1. Most important step, you need to get Java 7u45 SPECIFICALLY update 45, and yes it need to be Java 7. Also please note, even if you are using a 64 bit computer you need to get Java 7u45 32 bit. PLEASE GET THE 32 BIT VERSION or else this wont work (yes, you can have both the 64 bit and the 32 bit java 7u45 installed)
Step 2. Get/use a web browser that is compatible with Java applets. A few examples are, any version of Chrome before Chrome 45. Old versions of FireFox also work but im not sure exactly which version of FireFox is still compatible with Java, and I do happen to have issues with older firefox, like it trying to update all the time. Internet Explorer is a good option if your on a old windows computer too.
Step 3. Configure your Java security settings to medium.
Step 4. This website/html code requires you to actually have the minecraft.jar itself on your computer. If you dont have .minecraft folder in C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Roaming then go to step 6. If you do, then bare with me.
Step 5. For the people with a .minecraft folder this can vary in terms of two things. Whether you have the "old" .minecraft (the 2010-2012 one) or if you have the modern one that most people have. go to "step modern" if you have the modern .minecraft If you dont know which one you have then hit the windows key and r (win+r) on your keyboard and type "appdata" (no parenthesis) into you to run box that just opened up. Then go to Roaming and .minecraft and find the bin folder. If its filled with folders with lots of random text, then you have the modern .minecraft. If your bin folder just has the "minecraft.jar and a couple other things then you have the old .minecraft and hopefully you should just be able to use the website/html as is without changing anything in your .minecraft unless you have a minecraft version thats too modern.. like 1.0 through 1.5.2, if you have these versions head to https://vault.omniarchive.uk/archive/java/client-alpha/a1.2.3_04.jar, rename what you just downloaded to minecraft.jar and replace your minecraft.jar with this one.
Step 6 This is for those without a .minecraft folder. If you already have one and did Step 5 then go away... your done with the How to. If you dont have a .minecraft folder you have to load the website/html file once in one of the browsers listed in Step 2. Nothing will happen which is ok. Exit the website once the java has loaded and then hit the windows key and r (win+r) on your keyboard and type "appdata" (no parenthesis) into you to run box that just opened up. Then go to Roaming and .minecraft. I belive either nothing should be there other than one folder and if its there just delete that one folder. Head to https://archive.org/download/alpha-launcher and download the bin.zip and extract it. then put the extracted bin folder into your newley generated .minecraft and boom your done!</p>
Step Modern: If you have the new one then you need to head to https://archive.org/download/alpha-launcher and download the bin.zip. After that extract it and place all the contents inside of it into your bin folder in your .minecraft folder. Also delete your options.txt in your .minecraft folder and backup your worlds (just in case)
<p>If your stuck and need help, thats ok :) figure it out yourself. Just kidding, make a issue thingy on my github page and I will TRY to help you.</p>

<p><em>Alright your done, Bye!</em></p>
